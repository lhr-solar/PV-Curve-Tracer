# PV-Curve-Tracer
This repository contains the code to build and run two specifica applications:
- The on board program written in C/C++ that controls the PV Curve Tracer STM32 board and its Nucleo uC, and
- A supplementary application written in Rust that both sends commands to the Nucleo over USB UART and visualizes packet data it recieves.

Hardware and software specifications are further detailed in this [design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_mX5-L8dKRy5v3fvBHf1SrL1WQtuMlX2vXN29rJ4RzM/edit?usp=sharing) (requires UTSVT group permissions).
